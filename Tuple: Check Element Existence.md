# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
x=("12", 8, "21", "10", "11", "52", "u", "n", "c", "e")
print('n' in tup)
print('8' in tup)

```

## Result
      A python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple,is successfully executed.
